<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This is not my recipe for my other favorite dish, mac and cheese.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3 suspiciously large apples (preferably ones that give off an eerie glow)</li>
    <li>1 cup of sugar (the sweeter, the sneakier)</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons of butter that insists it’s margarine (just let it live its lie)</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon of cinnamon, stolen from a friendly witch's pantry</li>
    <li>1 cup of flour (freshly harvested from the Garden of Gluten)</li>
    <li>1 egg laid by a chicken with a mysterious backstory</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon of salt, for balance (but mostly for drama)</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon of vanilla extract (if it smells like it's plotting something, you're doing it right)</li>
    <li>A handful of crushed dreams (optional, but highly recommended)</li>
    <li>A pie crust that somehow manifested in your fridge overnight</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Summon the pie crust: Take the mysteriously appeared pie crust from your fridge. If it starts whispering, pretend you
    didn’t hear it.</li>
    <li>Charm the apples: Peel and slice the glowing apples, but do it carefully—don’t make eye contact or they might roll off
    the table in protest.</li>
    <li>Sift the flour: Whisper ancient baking incantations while sifting the flour. This won’t help the pie, but it will make
    you feel important.</li>
    <li>Melt the butter: Heat the butter until it begins to question its identity. Stir in sugar and cinnamon, allowing the
    mixture to simmer until it smells like happiness and chaos.</li>
    <li>Whisk the egg: Gently beat the egg while asking it deep existential questions about its journey from chicken to pie.</li>
    <li>Mix the dreams: Combine your flour, salt, and crushed dreams in a large bowl. Stir while contemplating life’s strange
    and unpredictable paths.</li>
    <li>Layer the ingredients: Place the apple slices in the pie crust, but do so dramatically. Pour the butter-cinnamon-sugar
    mixture over the apples like you’re the villain in a baking soap opera.</li>
    <li>Bake with hope: Place the pie in the oven at 375°F and bake for 45 minutes. Spend the next 45 minutes trying to convince
    yourself that the kitchen isn’t haunted.</li>
    <li>Cool with suspicion: Let the pie cool, but keep an eye on it. If it starts vibrating or glowing brighter, call a priest.</li>
    <li>Serve with confusion: Cut the pie and serve with a scoop of ice cream and a side of existential dread. Enjoy your
    weirdly delicious creation!</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Enjoy!</strong></p>
